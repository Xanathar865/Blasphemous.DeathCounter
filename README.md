**Blasphemous Death Counter!**

This mod does what it says, counts every time you die per save file and displays the number on the top right corner of the map screen.

**Console Commands**

  - *deathcounter help* - Shows a list of commands

  - *deathcounter current* - Tells you your current deaths in the console

  - *deathcounter set NUMBER* - Set your death count manually to the provided number (cannot set it to more than 10 000 via console)

  - *deathcounter reset* - Reset your number of deaths to zero (This command displays your previous death count as well so you can set it back if you made a mistake)

**Planned Features**

- The option to display death count upon beating the game, with optional messages praising or making fun of the player based on their deaths (with configurable thresholds)

- A skull icon to replace the "Deaths =" in the map menu to better match the cherub and map icons

- The option to change the colour of the text or icon of the skull based on certain configurable death thresholds

- More stat displays in the future? Possible options:

      - Bile flasks used
      - Damage dealt
      - Damage taken
      - Hits taken
      - Spike/falling deaths
      - Prayers cast
